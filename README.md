# Readora

Readora is a web and mobile application for reading and managing your favorite books. This guide provides instructions on how to set up and run the project on both web and Android platforms.

## Architecture

This project follows a hybrid architecture, where a single codebase is used for both web and mobile platforms. The core application is built with React and Vite, and it is then wrapped in a native Android shell using Capacitor. This approach allows for a consistent user experience across platforms while minimizing development overhead.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server for modern web projects.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability.
- **Capacitor**: A cross-platform native runtime for building web apps that run on iOS, Android, and the web.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs without leaving your HTML.
- **Shadcn/ui**: A collection of reusable UI components for React.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following key directories:

- **`src/`**: Contains the core application source code, including React components, pages, hooks, and utility functions.
- **`public/`**: Stores static assets that are publicly accessible, such as images and fonts.
- **`android/`**: The native Android project generated by Capacitor. This directory is managed by Android Studio.
- **`dist/`**: The output directory for the web build, containing the compiled and optimized assets.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) for running the Android application.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:knull-reaper/readora.git
cd readora
npm install
```

## Running on the Web

To run the application in a web browser, use the following command. This will start a local development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Once the server is running, you can access the application at `http://localhost:5173` (the default port for Vite).

## Running on Android

To run the application on an Android device or emulator, follow these steps:

1.  **Build the web assets:**
    This command compiles the React application and prepares it for Capacitor.

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2.  **Sync with Android:**
    This command copies the web assets into the native Android project and updates the dependencies.

    ```bash
    npx cap sync android
    ```

3.  **Open in Android Studio:**
    This command opens the Android project in Android Studio, where you can build and run the app.

    ```bash
    npx cap open android
    ```

4.  **Run the App:**
    In Android Studio, select a virtual device (emulator) or a connected physical device and click the "Run" button. Android Studio will handle the rest, installing and launching the application on the selected device.
